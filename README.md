Code that I have written for fun and practice

Will Write descriptions of each file as they get added:

MastermindCode.py - is a mastermind game written in Python.  This game generates a code of 4 integers from 1 to 5.  The user gets 10 guesses to try and break the code.  After each guess the computer returns how many numbers were in the correct spot and how many numbers are used but in the wrong spot.  If the user gets the code it is a win!  If the user can not crack the code in ten guesses the user loses.

coinFlip.py - is a coin flip generator written in Python.  The generator takes in an integer number fof flips from the user and then flips a coin that many times.  it then outputs the percentages of heads and tails flips.

ticTacToe.py - is a tic tac toe game written in Python.  This game can be played in hard or easy mode.  In easy mode the computer randomly places an X or an O somewhere on the board.  In hard mode the computer uses an algorithm to try and win the game.  The user selects weather they want to be X or O and then the computer randomly decides who gets the first move.  The game proceeds untill there is a winner or it is a tie.

connectFour.py - is a connect four game written in Python.  This game is played versus a computer.  The board is generated as a 6x7 matrix.  A disk can only be placed on the lowest row of the board that does not contain a disk, disks pile on top of each other.  The goal is to get four of your disk in a row, horizontaly, verticaly, or diagnoly.  The program decides who goes first.  the computer makes an educated decision on what location to place its disk.  The game ends when the user or computer wins or there is a tie.
